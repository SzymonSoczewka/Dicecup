# Dice-cup
The app must be composed of two activities. The main activity is where the user
throws the dices. Further, the user can select the number of dices (between 1 and 6)
and go to the history. The app should keep track of the recent history of results and
show these in a listview. Here it should also be possible to clear the history. See a
proposal for the GUI below.
The app should be robust
against turning the
device, meaning that the
state of the app should
survive turning the
device. The state of the
app are the faces of the
dices in the main activity
and the items in the
history. The history
should not be persisted;
meaning that the history
will be cleared when the
app is stopped.
