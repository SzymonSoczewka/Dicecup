# Dice-cup
Exercise 4 from Mobile dev. 
Make an app that emulates a dice cup. Here the user can click the Roll button and the program will show dices with random values. 
Here you must give the user the option of selecting the number of dices (1..6). 
It can be by using a spinner or buttons for increment and decrement, or ...?
Further the app should have the history; it is the last 5 results. 
The history can be cleared by clicking the Clear button. See a draft for the user interface below.
